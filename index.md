## Introduction

The consumption of everyday commodity products offers the potential to reveal societal inequalities, as well as to identify social milieus including their habits and behaviors. With transactions from more than 2500 households from different societal status over 2 years we try to identify hidden relationships and patterns. This project work will focus on two consecutive interwined aspects: societal latent structures in consumption and transaction behavior and vegetarianism.

## Consumption Behaviour

Are there differences in the meat consumption between incomes? Do people with a higher income eat more or less week per? To find out, we calculate the weight of meat, bought per household and normalize this by the number of people in the household, and the duration of data-collection for this household.

Let's look at a plot of the different income groups we have. To be able to actually say anything about the data, we also plot the 95% confidence interval.

We notice a few things: Lower income people with an income of less than 15K per year tend to buy more meat that people that earn between 75-149K. On the one hand, this seems counter-intuitive, since meat can be very expensive. On the other hand, nowadays many cheap meat products from factory farming exist.

Another interesting observation is that the lowest meat consumption comes from the high-income bracket of 200-249K. The consumption is significantly lower than of the beforementioned income brackets.

It seems there is an inverse relation between the income people have and their meat consumption. Possible explanations might be that higher income people buy less food in general...

... or that they are more conscious about their food choices, buying for example fewer, but higher quality meats.

Meat consumption is way less clear for the different age categories. In fact we can't say there is any significant difference between the age groups.

It is different for the marital status, as we can see that households of married couples eat way less meat than single person households or households were the data doesn't specify. This might be due to healthier food choices made by parents, which are more likely to occur in married households.

<div style="background-color:orange; width:100%; padding:20px; color:black;">Check this hypothesis (are there more kids in married households)!</div>

## How do consumers react to those campaigns?
