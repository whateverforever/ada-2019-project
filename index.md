## Introduction

The consumption of everyday commodity products offers the potential to reveal societal inequalities, as well as to identify social milieus including their habits and behaviors. With transactions from more than 2500 households from different societal status over 2 years we try to identify hidden relationships and patterns. This project work will focus on two consecutive interwined aspects: societal latent structures in consumption and transaction behavior and vegetarianism.

## What kind of househoulds do we observe?
- age distribution (plot)
- household composition distribution
- income distribution

## Comsumption behaviour
- amount of meat consumed per group 
- consumption non-veg vs veg per group

## Campaign and what kind of food they promote
Marketing plays a big role in people's grocery shopping behaviour. Are people directed to buy meat and fish? To take a look at that we observe two marketing aspects: Campaigns which distribute coupons and advertisment.

We first look at the coupons distributed by the 30 campaigns. To get an vague idea of the campaigns, we look at how many coupons they distribute and at how many coupons are actually redeemed.

Let's take a closer look at the coupons and what food categories are promoted.

Do the campaigns promote meat and fish consumption?

The campaign individual shares of meat or fish related coupons are mostly low. Furthermore, vegetarian products are promoted more. It seems like campaigns do not promote meat and fish consumption. 

It is also interesting to see how many of the distributed coupons are redeemed in the end.

The proportions of distributed and redeemed coupons are quite similar. Thus, the usage rate of meat and fish coupons and vegetarian coupons are comparable aswell. We can draw the conclusion that campaigns do not direct people to buy non-vegetarian food. 

Next, we look at the other marketing aspect: advertisement. How are the different food categories advertised?

The best postition in a magazine is certainly the front page. Approximately 15% of all meat and only 1% of the fish products are advertised on the frontpage. On the other hand, vegetarian animal product are in 30% of the time are displayed on the frontpage. The numbers for vegetables and fruits are 10% and 7% respectively. Again, it does not appear that meat or fish is particularly advertised.

In conclusion, we can say that marketing does not promote meat and fish consumption.


## How do consumers react to those campaigns?
